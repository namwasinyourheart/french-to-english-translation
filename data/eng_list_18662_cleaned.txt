i saw a man get hit by a car .
all i can do is to do my best .
i did it the way he told me to .
i felt it was my duty to do it .
we plan to go as far as we can .
why do i have to go to my room ?
can i get a cup of coffee to go ?
do you mind if i take a day off ?
do you mind if i turn on the tv ?
he did it the way i told him to .
he will be back in a day or two .
how hard is it to get a fake id ?
i had a son who died in the war .
i know we can do this if we try .
i told tom why i had to do that .
i wish i had a reason not to go .
my boss is twice as old as i am .
all you have to do is to join us .
do you mind if i sit next to you ?
do you mind if i turn off the ac ?
do you want to take a look at it ?
do you want to talk to me or not ?
he is the last man i want to see .
i am not the person i used to be .
i felt a drop of rain on my head .
i get paid a lot to do what i do .
i had a cold , so i stayed in bed .
i have a coat , but i have no hat .
i have to pick up my son at 2:30 .
i know how hard it is to do that .
i lost one of my boys in the war .
i think tom has a long way to go .
i want to go home to see my wife .
i'll let you know in a day or so .
i'm not as agile as i used to be .
it was so hot i took my coat off .
all i want is for you to be happy .
all you have to do is to meet her .
as far as i know , he's a nice guy .
as the bus was late , i got a taxi .
do you mind if i turn down the tv ?
do you want me to call you a taxi ?
he put the skis on top of the car .
how about you and i go for a walk ?
how can i know if a girl likes me ?
i awoke to find a bird in my room .
i came to warn you not to do that .
i can give you a lift if you like .
i can't go now . i have work to do .
i didn't do what i was told to do .
i don't know if i can do this job .
i don't see why i need to do this .
i don't want you to do what i did .
i go to any party i am invited to .
i have a right to be on this ship .
i just did what you told me to do .
i owe what i am today to my uncle .
i saw a white bird on my way home .
i told you i need a few more days .
i told you it was a waste of time .
i told you not to call me at work .
i told you to leave it in the car .
i want tom to take a look at that .
i want a tie to go with this suit .
i want to buy a pair of ski boots .
i want you to have a copy of this .
i want you to know how sorry i am .
i want you to take a look at this .
i was born the same day as my dog .
i wish i had a reason not to stay .
i'd like a word with you if i may .
i'm not as rich as i'd like to be .
i'm not rich , nor do i wish to be .
i'm not the same guy i used to be .
if i had time to do that , i would .
is that all you have to say to me ?
look , i want you to do me a favor .
she may be a nurse . i am not sure .
we have to do the work in one day .
air is to us what water is to fish .
all i want now is a glass of water .
all i want you to do is talk to us .
do you mind if i take my shirt off ?
have i told you how i broke my leg ?
he didn't say a word to me all day .
he has been sick in bed for a week .
he has twice as many books as i do .
he is very clever for a boy of ten .
he may be the very man that i need .
he was dazed by a blow to the head .
how can i get to the zoo from here ?
i am about as big as my father now .
i am so busy that i can't help you .
i can make the time to talk to you .
i did not expect it to be that big .
i do not think that she is at home .
i don't know what i can do to help .
i don't know what i want to do yet .
i don't know why i have to do this .
i don't need to be told what to do .
i don't think tom is as fast as me .
i don't want my son to be like you .
i don't want to be a burden to you .
i don't want to be told what to do .
i feel it's a tad risky to do that .
i found a note on my door from tom .
i get paid at the end of the month .
i got off with a slap on the wrist .
i got to the bus stop just in time .
i have a bad pain in my lower back .
i have a fever and i ache all over .
i hope no one saw you come in here .
i just did what they told me to do .
i just did what you asked me to do .
i know it won't be easy to do that .
i love you and i want to marry you .
i owe what i am today to my father .
i think i saw a ghost in the woods .
i think it's best if i go home now .
i thought you had to be up by 7 . 30 .
i told tom i wanted to go with him .
i told tom how to get to our house .
i told tom why i wanted to do that .
i want a book to read on the train .
i want to do my job the best i can .
i want you to love me for who i am .
i want you to tell me who did this .
i'll be out of town for a few days .
i'm not in the mood to do that now .
i'm not sure i want to do this now .
if i don't do it now , i never will .
is this a good time to buy a house ?
it looks like i came at a bad time .
it may be that he is not a bad man .
it was so cold that we made a fire .
it won't be hard for us to do that .
it won't be hard for us to do this .
it's time for you to buy a new car .
mary came up to me when she saw me .
there are a lot of fish in the sea .
there is a lot of snow on the roof .
they went on a trip a few days ago .
tom is tall , but not as tall as me .
who are you to tell us we can't go ?
you don't know tom as well as i do .
a map helps us to know where we are .
air is to man what water is to fish .
air is to men what water is to fish .
all you have to do is try your best .
all you have to do is write it down .
are you telling me how to do my job ?
as far as i know , he is not married .
as soon as the bell rang , we got up .
can one of you open the door for me ?
can you tell me what you want to do ?
did you get here by bus or by train ?
do you mind if i turn off the light ?
do you think what she said is a lie ?
do you want me to watch tom for you ?
do you want to see what i just made ?
don't treat me as if i were a child .
he can run as fast as any other boy .
he comes to see my son now and then .
he cried as if he were a boy of six .
he is as great a poet as ever lived .
he is not too poor to buy a bicycle .
he is not what he was ten years ago .
he is what we call a man of culture .
he put the key on the desk as usual .
he told me that i could use his car .
he was fed up with life in the city .
his name is on the tip of my tongue .
i almost died a year and a half ago .
i as well as my brother am to blame .
i asked a friend of mine to help us .
i beg you to give me a little water .
i can do it if you give me a chance .
i can hear you , but i can't see you .
i caught a cold , and i have a fever .
i didn't do what they told me to do .
i didn't get to the end of the book .
i didn't know that i had to do that .
i don't know any other way to do it .
i don't know if i can do that again .
i don't know why he said that to me .
i don't know why we need to do that .
i don't like the way you talk to me .
i don't need you to take care of me .
i don't think he is fit for the job .
i gave tom a chance to work with me .
i go to bed at ten o'clock at night .
i go to the beach as often as i can .
i got out of the car at 40th street .
i got tired of lying in bed all day .
i had a good idea a few minutes ago .
i have a car that was made in japan .
i have a lot of things i want to do .
i have no idea what i'm going to do .
i have no idea where i left my keys .
i have no idea why she got so angry .
i have no one to turn to except you .
i have nothing to say to any of you .
i have to take a bus to go anywhere .
i hope we can make it to your party .
i hope you like what i made for you .
i just got there as fast as i could .
i just want you to know i regret it .
i knew there had to be a better way .
i knew this was too good to be true .
i know tom and only tom can do that .
i know tom told mary not to do that .
i know it's not as easy as it looks .
i left some stuff i need in the car .
i need more time to make up my mind .
i need to tell my wife i'll be late .
i owe what i am today to my parents .
i think it would be hard to do that .
i think we have a lot to talk about .
i think you know where i want to go .
i told you this was a waste of time .
i tried my best to get here on time .
i want a knife to cut the rope with .
i want my parents to be proud of me .
i want to hear what you have to say .
i want to show you what tom gave me .
i want you in my office in one hour .
i want you to go to boston with tom .
i want you to help me choose a book .
i want you to know you can trust me .
i was bitten in the leg by that dog .
i was hot , so i switched on the fan .
i will never tell a lie from now on .
i wish i could do that , but i can't .
i wonder if tom knows how busy i am .
i wonder if you could do me a favor .
i'd like to get you both to help me .
i'll be in my office if you need me .
i'll do my best to be ready on time .
i'm not as gullible as i used to be .
i'm not as stupid as you think i am .
i'm not even sure if this is my key .
if i don't do it , it won't get done .
if i told you , i'd have to kill you .
if you don't want me to go , i won't .
if you ever need a job , come see me .
if you give me a book , i'll read it .
it is a pity that you can't join us .
it was very nice of you to say that .
it's all over for me . i lost my job .
my father is not as old as he looks .
she felt as if she had seen a ghost .
she was born at six a . m . on july 17 .
the doctor did a good job on my leg .
the old man was almost hit by a car .
the word is on the tip of my tongue .
this is just the type of car i want .
this word is both a noun and a verb .
tom and i did our best to help mary .
tom came here to ask us to help him .
tom did exactly as i told him to do .
tom may not be as happy as he seems .
tom only does what i tell him to do .
tom told mary he had to talk to her .
tom took his new car out for a spin .
we didn't want to go , but we had to .
we saw a lot of ships in the harbor .
what can i do to help you right now ?
what he said turned out to be a lie .
what time do you want me to be here ?
what was it that we were told to do ?
why did you wait so long to tell me ?
why do you need to read such a book ?
you could sit on my lap if you want .
you don't know how to do it , do you ?
you don't think i can do it , do you ?
will you go ? i will if i have to .
an old man sat next to me on the bus .
anyone can do it as long as they try .
are you going to stay in bed all day ?
as far as i know , he's an honest man .
as far as i know , she is a kind girl .
as soon as i got home , i went to bed .
can i talk to you alone for a second ?
can you tell me what day it is today ?
can you tell me where i can find tom ?
could i talk to the two of you alone ?
did you come here by train or by bus ?
do a lot of people live in your town ?
do you eat it with a spoon or a fork ?
do you have a file in the tool chest ?
do you have any idea what time it is ?
do you mind if i ask a few questions ?
do you mind if i take off my sweater ?
do you think it was tom who did that ?
do you want me to sing you a lullaby ?
do you want to come eat at our house ?
do you want to go to a movie tonight ?
do you want to go to the zoo with me ?
don't try to do two things at a time .
don't you want to ask me what i want ?
either you or i must go in his place .
he came to tokyo at the age of three .
he did it not for me but for himself .
he did what he promised to do for me .
he is by far the wisest of the three .
he left japan at the end of the year .
he let his dog run free in the field .
he must be crazy to say such a thing .
he ran toward me as fast as he could .
he said he would see me the next day .
he took pity on me and helped me out .
he was born in a small town in italy .
he will be my deputy while i am away .
how can i tell if i'm really in love ?
how do you know i even want that job ?
how many times a week do you do that ?
how many times a week do you eat out ?
i am going to have a great day today .
i am not the captain of the new team .
i asked her to go to a movie with me .
i asked him if i could read his book .
i awoke to find a burglar in my room .
i can buy what i need on my way home .
i can't do what i'm being paid to do .
i can't keep my coat on in this heat .
i can't put up with the way he spits .
i can't talk right now . i need to go .
i did say that , but i didn't mean it .
i didn't know tom was going to do it .
i didn't say it was going to be easy .
i don't care if our team wins or not .
i don't eat out as often as i'd like .
i don't get paid as much as i'd like .
i don't get up as early as my mother .
i don't have a lot of time right now .
i don't have time to talk to you now .
i don't know if i should stay or run .
i don't know what you want me to say .
i don't know when i can take a break .
i don't know why tom is scared of me .
i don't like the way he looks at you .
i don't like the way he speaks to me .
i don't see tom as often as i'd like .
i don't think she is fit for the job .
i don't think we can do it that soon .
i feel very sick . i want to throw up .
i felt it was necessary , so i did it .
i gave orders i was to be left alone .
i grasped the rope so as not to fall .
i guess it's too late to do that now .
i had a drink or two before you came .
i had my hair cut at a barber's shop .
i have a son not much older than you .
i have no idea how to use this thing .
i have no idea what tom said to mary .
i haven't got rid of my bad cold yet .
i kept the $20 i found in the street .
i know tom is a lot taller than mary .
i know tom won't allow me to do that .
i know him by name , but not by sight .
i know him by sight , but not by name .
i love both of you with all my heart .
i love the sound of rain on the roof .
i make it a rule not to stay up late .
i met him on my way home from school .
i need to ask you for a little favor .
i need you to focus and listen to me .
i now know what i told you was wrong .
i plan to get a job as soon as i can .
i refuse to be taken in by her guile .
i saw a black cat run into the house .
i see why you don't want to go there .
i still don't know what i want to do .
i still love the way you smile at me .
i talk to tom on the phone every day .
i think i can do it in my spare time .
i think it's going to be a good year .
i think it's time for me to speak up .
i think it's time for you to grow up .
i think it's too late to do that now .
i think that it was tom who did that .
i think you are the one who broke it .
i think you know what has to be done .
i think you know why i can't do that .
i thought i saw a rabbit on the road .
i took a shower and then went to bed .
i tried to get tom to learn to drive .
i used one of my old shirts as a rag .
i used to play with a couple of boys .
i used to take a walk in the morning .
i want to be someone you can turn to .
i want you focus on the here and now .
i want you to play the guitar for me .
i want you to tell me how to do this .
i was just doing what had to be done .
i was late because i had a flat tire .
i was sick , so i didn't go to school .
i went for a walk to try to sober up .
i went to get the file you asked for .
i went to the airport to see him off .
i went to the library to read a book .
i wish i could help you , but i can't .
i wish i could take back what i said .
i woke up in the middle of the night .
i wonder if tom is trying to kill me .
i wonder if tom will ask for my help .
i would like you to go instead of me .
i wouldn't bet on that if i were you .
i'd like to go with you , but i can't .
i'll see what else i can find to eat .
i'll try to do that before i go home .
i'm glad to be the one who tells you .
i'm glad to have a roof over my head .
i'm lucky that no one saw me do that .
i'm not in the mood to do that today .
i'm not sure if it's a boy or a girl .
i'm not the only one who can do this .
i'm not the only one who wants to go .
i'm sorry it had to be done this way .
i'm sure tom told you not to do that .
i'm sure it won't be easy to do that .
i've got a meeting i've got to go to .
i've taught my dog to sit up and beg .
if i pay you a dollar , we'll be even .
if i were a bird , i could fly to you .
if you need me , i'll be in my office .
is there any other way i can pay you ?
it is time for me to take a vacation .
it isn't good to read in a dark room .
it seems to me that we should go now .
it was tom who told me you were sick .
it was a nice day to go to the beach .
it was in london that i last saw her .
it was kind of you to do that for us .
it was too nice a day to stay inside .
it was too windy to play in the park .
it wasn't us who you saw in that car .
it's a good idea , but is it worth it ?
it's only over if you let it be over .
let me tell you how tom and mary met .
may i count on you to get me the job ?
my father is busy as a bee every day .
my father is too busy to take a walk .
my teacher put in a good word for me .
my uncle has made me what i am today .
no one is able to run as fast as tom .
on a clear day , you can see mt . fuji .
our dog was nearly run over by a car .
she has about as many stamps as i do .
she has an uncle who works in a bank .
she hit me on the head with a hammer .
she used the car to go to the office .
tell tom i don't want to talk to him .
tell tom i'll pick him up on the way .
the dog was in a box under the table .
there are a lot of books in his room .
there are a lot of fish in that lake .
there are a lot of girls in the room .
there was a lot of food in the house .
there's so much i want to say to you .
this desk is a little too low for me .
this kind of book is of no use to us .
this lid is so tight i can't open it .
this lid is too tight for me to open .
this old car is yours if you want it .
tom and i went to a party last night .
tom asked mary if she had to do that .
tom asked mary to wake him up at six .
tom had his car key in his left hand .
tom is a warlock and mary is a witch .
tom is one of the nicest guys i know .
tom is the kind of man you can trust .
tom led a quiet life in a quiet town .
tom puts gas in his car twice a week .
tom said he was ill , which was a lie .
tom told me why he didn't want to go .
was it hard for you to find my house ?
was that all you wanted to say to me ?
we don't need a visa to go to france .
we got a taxi so we wouldn't be late .
we have a lot more food than we need .
we sang in a choir when we were kids .
we want tom to know he can come home .
what do you want me to do with these ?
what kind of woman do you think i am ?
what time will you have to go to bed ?
why are you up at this time of night ?
you are very kind to show me the way .
you can get there by train or by bus .
you don't know what it is to be poor .
you don't need to be in such a hurry .
you have no idea who that is , do you ?
you may as well tell me all about it .
you wanted me to get a job , so i did .
you won't be able to get up so early .
are you a cop ? no . why do you ask ?
are you angry at me ? you bet i am !
a bat is no more a bird than a rat is .
a wise man would not say such a thing .
a wisp of hair fell over his left eye .
a young man waited in line to see him .
all i ask is that you show up on time .
all i ask of you is a little patience .
all i know is that he came from china .
all i know is that she left last week .
all you have to do is wash the dishes .
ask him whether she is at home or not .
can i talk to you for a second please ?
can you shut the door on your way out ?
can you tell us a bit more about that ?
could you drop me off at the bus stop ?

i can't go with you . i have a meeting .
i can't help the way i feel about you .
i can't think of any reason not to go .
i cannot feel at home in such a hotel .
i didn't think we'd be able to get in .
i don't care as long as you are happy .

i have to say goodbye to a few people .
i have to stop that . it's a bad habit .
i haven't decided yet if i want to go .
i hear from my mother once in a while .
i hope tom is the last one to do that .
i hope we don't have to wait too long .
i just don't want our luck to run out .
i just don't want to see you get hurt .
i just sent you a present in the mail .
